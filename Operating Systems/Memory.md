# Physical Memory
_Hardware in the form of RAM installed on the computer._
Fixed size based on the amount of RAM physically installed.
Directly accessible by the CPU.
Data is stored using physical addresses representing the actual locations on the memory chips.
# Virtual Memory
_An abstraction provided by the operating system, creating the illusion of large contiguous memory._
Even if the physical memory is limited, programs can assume they have more memory available than the actual installed RAM.
# Pages
_A fixed length block of memory._
RAM is split into small equally sized chunks when a program runs.
The program is the book, and the pages are the sections you are interesting in reading.
