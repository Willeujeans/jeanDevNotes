# Resource Allocation Graph
_shows which resource is held by which process and which process is waiting for a resource of a specific kind._
Therefore, resource allocation graph describe what the condition of the system as far as process and resources are concern like what number of resources are allocated and what is the request of each process.
The state of the system in terms of processes and resources
1. **Process Vertex:** Every process will be represented as a process vertex. Generally, the process will be represented with a circle.
2. **Resource Vertex:** Every resource will be represented as a resource vertex. It is also two types:
	- Single instance type resource: It represents as a box, inside the box, there will be one dot. So the number of dots indicate how many instances are present of each resource type.
	- Multi-resource instance type resource: It also represents as a box, inside the box, there will be many dots present.
